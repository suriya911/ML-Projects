# Adult Salary Prediction

This project aims to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 based on census data. The dataset used for this project is the Adult Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Machine Learning Algorithm

We have employed the Random Forest Classifier for this prediction task. The model has achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset.

## Installation

To set up the environment and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
